OLD README
==========
- In order to deploy this translation, you first need to convert it from UTF-8 to ASCII, which is the encoding zimbra uses. You may do it with the following command (change according to new versions of the jdk)
/opt/zimbra/java/bin/native2ascii -encoding UTF-8 ZmMsg.properties ZmMsg_ca.properties
- Note that if you want to use an ISO-8859-1 encoded file, you have to change the command accordingly

- Then, we make a backup of the zimbra language file, if there is any
cp /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/WEB-INF/classes/messages/ZmMsg_ca.properties ./ZmMsg_ca.properties.old
- And last, we copy our file in place
cp ZmMsg_ca.properties /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/WEB-INF/classes/messages/ZmMsg_ca.properties

- Remember, in order to update the language strings, you have to
	- zmcontrol stop
	- zmcontrol start
	- Clean your browser's cache

Good luck!
